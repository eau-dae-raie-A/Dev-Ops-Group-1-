üìå Characteristic Information

	‚Ä¢       Goal in Context:
	‚Ä¢       As a data analyst, I want to generate a report of all countries in a specific continent, organized by population from largest to smallest, so that I can compare populations within a continent.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Scope:
	‚Ä¢       Population data for a specific continent.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Level:
