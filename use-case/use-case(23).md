üìå Characteristic Information

	‚Ä¢       Goal in Context:
	‚Ä¢       As a data analyst, I want to generate a report of the total population, people living in cities, and people not living in cities for each continent so that I can understand population distribution within continents.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Scope:
	‚Ä¢       Population data for each continent, including urban and non-urban populations.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Level:
	‚Ä¢       Primary task.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Preconditions:
	‚Ä¢       The database contains current and accurate population figures, including urban and non-urban populations, for each continent.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Success End Condition:
	‚Ä¢       A report showing the total population, urban population, and non-urban population for each continent is produced and delivered to the researcher for analysis.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Failed End Condition:
	‚Ä¢       No report is generated.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Primary Actor:
	‚Ä¢       Data Analyst.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Trigger:
	‚Ä¢       A request from data analystis made to retrieve population distribution data for each continent for analysis.

üõ† Main Success Scenario

	‚Ä¢	The system receives a request for population data, including urban and non-urban populations, for each continent.
	‚Ä¢	The system retrieves up-to-date population figures for each continent, including the breakdown of urban and non-urban populations.
	‚Ä¢	The system organizes the data into a report, showing the total population, urban population, and non-urban population for each continent.
	‚Ä¢	The system generates the report and delivers it to the researcher for analysis.

üö® Extensions

	‚Ä¢	If population data for some continents is missing:
	‚Ä¢	The system proceeds with the available data.
