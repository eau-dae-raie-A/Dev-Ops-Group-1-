üåç USE CASE 14: Produce a Report of the Top N Populated Cities in a Region

üìå Characteristic Information

	‚Ä¢       Goal in Context:
	‚Ä¢       As a researcher, I want to generate a report of the top N populated cities in a region, where N is provided by the researcher, so that I can compare city populations within that region.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Scope:
	‚Ä¢       Population data for cities within a specific region.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Level:
	‚Ä¢       Primary task.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Preconditions:
	‚Ä¢       The specific region is known.
	‚Ä¢       The database contains current and accurate population figures for cities within the region.
	‚Ä¢       The researcher provides a value for N (the number of top cities to retrieve).
	
    ‚Ä¢       Success End Condition:
	‚Ä¢       A report with the top N populated cities in the specified region is produced and delivered to the researcher for analysis.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Failed End Condition:
	‚Ä¢       No report is generated, or N is not provided.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Primary Actor:
	‚Ä¢       Researcher.
	
    ‚Ä¢       Trigger:
	‚Ä¢       A request from data analyst is made to retrieve the top N populated cities within a region for analysis.

üõ† Main Success Scenario

	‚Ä¢	The system receives the value for N (e.g., top 10, top 20, etc.) from the researcher.
	‚Ä¢	The system retrieves up-to-date population figures for all cities within the specified region from the database.
	‚Ä¢	The system organizes the cities by population size, sorting them from largest to smallest.
	‚Ä¢	The system selects the top N cities based on the researcher‚Äôs input.
	‚Ä¢	The system generates the report and delivers it to the researcher for analysis.

üö® Extensions

	‚Ä¢	If N is not provided by the researcher:
	‚Ä¢	The system prompts the researcher to provide a valid value for N.
	‚Ä¢	If population data for some cities within the region is missing:
	‚Ä¢	The system proceeds with the available data.

üîÄ Sub-Variations

	‚Ä¢	None.
